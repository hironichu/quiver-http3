// MARK: - Extended CONNECT Context

/// Context for an incoming Extended CONNECT request (RFC 9220).
///
/// Wraps an Extended CONNECT request with the underlying QUIC stream,
/// allowing the server to accept (200) or reject the request.
/// When accepted, the CONNECT stream remains open for the session lifetime
/// (e.g., for WebTransport session use).
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// for await context in connection.incomingExtendedConnect {
///     if context.request.isWebTransportConnect {
///         // Accept the WebTransport session
///         try await context.accept()
///         // The stream is now open for WebTransport session use
///         let sessionStream = context.stream
///     } else {
///         // Reject unknown protocols
///         try await context.reject(status: 501)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
